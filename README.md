1. PROJECT OVERVIEW 
Modern computing systems, deadlocks are a critical issue that can lead to system 
inefficiencies, increased latency, and resource wastage. Our project, AI-Powered Deadlock 
Detection System, is designed to identify and resolve deadlocks in real-time using advanced 
artificial intelligence techniques. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and intelligent 
monitoring, this system enhances process synchronization and resource allocation, 
minimizing performance bottlenecks. 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a deployable and user-friendly solution that can 
detect, analyze, and mitigate deadlocks effectively. The system features an intuitive 
dashboard for real-time monitoring, providing visual insights into process interactions and 
deadlock occurrences. With a modular architecture and seamless integration capabilities, this 
AI-driven system is suitable for diverse environments, including operating systems, 
databases, and distributed computing frameworks.
